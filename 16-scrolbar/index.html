        The Eiffel Tower (/ˈaɪfəl/ EYE-fəl; French: Tour Eiffel [tuʁ ɛfɛl] ⓘ) is
        a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It
        is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and
        built the tower from 1887 to 1889. Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer"
        (French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed as the centerpiece of the
        1889 World's Fair. Although initially criticised by some of France's
        leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a
        global cultural icon of France and one of the most recognisable
        structures in the world.[3] The tower received 5,889,000 visitors in
        2022.[4] The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance
        fee in the world:[5] 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015. It was
        designated a monument historique in 1964, and was named part of a UNESCO
        World Heritage Site ("Paris, Banks of the Seine") in 1991.[6]

        The tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall,[7] about the same height as an
        81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is
        square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its
        construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to
        become the tallest human-made structure in the world, a title it held
        for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished
        in 1930. It was the first structure in the world to surpass both the
        200-metre and 300-metre mark in height. Due to the addition of a
        broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller
        than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding
        transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing
        structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.

        The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on the first
        and second levels. The top level's upper platform is 276 m (906 ft)
        above the ground – the highest observation deck accessible to the public
        in the European Union. Tickets can be purchased to ascend by stairs or
        lift to the first and second levels. The climb from ground level to the
        first level is over 300 steps, as is the climb from the first level to
        the second, making the entire ascent a 600 step climb. Although there is
        a staircase to the top level, it is usually accessible only by lift. On
        this top, third level is a private apartment built for Gustave Eiffel's
        private use. He decorated it with furniture by Jean Lachaise and invited
        friends such as Thomas Edison.

        Work on the foundations started on 28 January 1887.[21] Those for the
        east and south legs were straightforward, with each leg resting on four
        2 m (6.6 ft) concrete slabs, one for each of the principal girders of
        each leg. The west and north legs, being closer to the river Seine, were
        more complicated: each slab needed two piles installed by using
        compressed-air caissons 15 m (49 ft) long and 6 m (20 ft) in diameter
        driven to a depth of 22 m (72 ft)[22] to support the concrete slabs,
        which were 6 m (20 ft) thick. Each of these slabs supported a block of
        limestone with an inclined top to bear a supporting shoe for the
        ironwork. Each shoe was anchored to the stonework by a pair of bolts 10
        cm (4 in) in diameter and 7.5 m (25 ft) long. The foundations were
        completed on 30 June, and the erection of the ironwork began. The
        visible work on-site was complemented by the enormous amount of exacting
        preparatory work that took place behind the scenes: the drawing office
        produced 1,700 general drawings and 3,629 detailed drawings of the
        18,038 different parts needed.[23] The task of drawing the components
        was complicated by the complex angles involved in the design and the
        degree of precision required: the position of rivet holes was specified
        to within 1 mm (0.04 in) and angles worked out to one second of arc.[24]
        The finished components, some already riveted together into
        sub-assemblies, arrived on horse-drawn carts from a factory in the
        nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois-Perret and were first bolted
        together, with the bolts being replaced with rivets as construction
        progressed. No drilling or shaping was done on site: if any part did not
        fit, it was sent back to the factory for alteration. In all, 18,038
        pieces were joined using 2.5 million rivets.[21]

        At first, the legs were constructed as cantilevers, but about halfway to
        the first level construction was paused to create a substantial timber
        scaffold. This renewed concerns about the structural integrity of the
        tower, and sensational headlines such as "Eiffel Suicide!" and "Gustave
        Eiffel Has Gone Mad: He Has Been Confined in an Asylum" appeared in the
        tabloid press.[25] At this stage, a small "creeper" crane designed to
        move up the tower was installed in each leg. They made use of the guides
        for the lifts which were to be fitted in the four legs. The critical
        stage of joining the legs at the first level was completed by the end of
        March 1888.[21] Although the metalwork had been prepared with the utmost
        attention to detail, provision had been made to carry out small
        adjustments to precisely align the legs; hydraulic jacks were fitted to
        the shoes at the base of each leg, capable of exerting a force of 800
        tonnes, and the legs were intentionally constructed at a slightly
        steeper angle than necessary, being supported by sandboxes on the
        scaffold. Although construction involved 300 on-site employees,[21] due
        to Eiffel's safety precautions and the use of movable gangways,
        guardrails and screens, only one person died.[26]

        In 1910, Father Theodor Wulf measured radiant energy at the top and
        bottom of the tower. He found more at the top than expected,
        incidentally discovering what are known today as cosmic rays.[36] Two
        years later, on 4 February 1912, Austrian tailor Franz Reichelt died
        after jumping from the first level of the tower (a height of 57 m) to
        demonstrate his parachute design.[37] In 1914, at the outbreak of World
        War I, a radio transmitter located in the tower jammed German radio
        communications, seriously hindering their advance on Paris and
        contributing to the Allied victory at the First Battle of the Marne.[38]
        From 1925 to 1934, illuminated signs for Citroën adorned three of the
        tower's sides, making it the tallest advertising space in the world at
        the time.[39] In April 1935, the tower was used to make experimental
        low-resolution television transmissions, using a shortwave transmitter
        of 200 watts power. On 17 November, an improved 180-line transmitter was
        installed.[40]
